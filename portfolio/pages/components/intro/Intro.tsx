            I am currently developing my skills as a software developer by building personal projects
            and exploring new tools. My main focus right now is creating web applications, but I would
            also love to make a game since I enjoy gaming. I have always enjoyed
            creating things and building tools.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy going to the gym, playing games, and watching Netflix,
            YouTube, or anything new in the cinema. Oh, and food is definitely one of my biggest passions.
            I cannot go a day without it üçú!
